# esx_inventoryhud-edit
Edit of trsak's original inventoryhud (only css and html)

# Credit
All credit goes towards Trsak's original resource, this is a REQUIREMENT for this to work [https://github.com/Trsak/esx_inventoryhud]
I also used some of Conde-B1G_Inventory's css to make the inventory look better, and changed it up a bit myself

# Dependencies
In order for this to work, you need this on your server [https://github.com/Trsak/esx_inventoryhud]

# Installing the new design
- Find esx_inventoryhud in your resources folder
